# A Practical Approach: Running Test cycle with different choices of Loss function and Activation Functions.

We will use Heart failure clinical record data set (source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data/data). We will use ANN model with several activation functions with the same loss function.

We are trying to predict / classify â€¦..  

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

By utilizing population-wide methods to address behavioral risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy food and obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol consumption, most cardiovascular diseases can be averted.

A ML or DL model can be very helpful in the early detection and management of cardiovascular disease or high-risk individuals.

Based only on serum creatinine and ejection fraction, we will be able to forecast the survival of individuals suffering from heart failure. For that, our goal is:

- To classify / predict whether a patient is prone to heart failure depending on multiple attributes.
- It is a binary classification with multiple numerical and categorical features.
